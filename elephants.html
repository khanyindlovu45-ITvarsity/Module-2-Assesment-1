                         <h3>ELEPHANTS</h3>
                         <p>The African elephant is the world's largest land mammal with males on average measuring up to 3m high and weighing up to 6 tonnes. Males only reach their full size at 35-40 years that is well over half their lifespan as wild elephants can live for up to 60-70 years. And it is not just the adults even calves are huge! 
                            At birth elephants can weigh 120kg, that is almost 19 stone.An elephant's skin is 2.5cm thick in most places.  The folds and wrinkles in their skin can retain up to 10 times more water than flat skin does, which helps to cool them down. 
                            They keep their skin clean and protect themselves from sunburn by taking regular dust and mud baths.</p>
                         <p>There are two species of elephant: African and Asian. The ears of African elephants are much larger than their cousins and are described as being shaped like the African continent, whereas the ears of Asian elephants are shaped like the Indian subcontinent. There is also a trunk difference,African elephants have two ‘fingers’ at the tip of their trunks, 
                            whereas Asian elephants have one.Elephants have around 150,000 muscle units in their trunk.
                          Their trunks are perhaps the most sensitive organ found in any mammal. Asian elephants have been seen to pick up a peanut, shell it, blow the shell out and eat the nut. Elephants use their trunks to suck up water to drink – it can contain up to 8 litres of water. They also use their trunks as a snorkel when swimming.</p>
                           <p>Elephants are herbivorous and can be found in different habitats including
                            savannahs, forests, deserts and marshes. They prefer to stay near water.</p>
                           <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                            <p>You will find the elephants at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>
