<p>This animal tends to top out at around 280-380 pounds for males and 220-250 pounds for females. Malayan tigers rarely grow heavier than around 220 pounds.

<p>In 2010, there were as few as 3,200 wild tigers. But now five countries - India, China, Nepal, Russia and Bhutan - have given hope for the future. In India alone, the number of wild tigers is now estimated at between 2,600 and 3,350 animals - which makes up around three-quarters of the world's population.</p>
 <p>Tigers thrive in areas where there are lots of foliage and prey. According to the Seaworld and Busch Gardens Animal Information Database, they can be found in tropical forests, evergreen forests, riverine woodlands, mangrove swamps, grasslands, savannas and rocky country.</p>
