                         <h3>MONKEY</h3>
<p>Monkey is a common name that may refer to certain groups or species of simian mammals of infraorder Simiiformes. The term is applied descriptively to groups of primates, such as families of New World monkeys and Old World monkeys.To attract a female partner, male capuchin monkeys will urinate in their hands and then rub it thoroughly into their fur.The smallest monkey in the world is the pygmy marmoset, with a body as little as 5 inches (12 cm) and a tail length of about 7 inches (17 cm). As a comparison, they are about the size of a hamster, can fit in the palm of a human hand, and they weigh the same as a pack of cards.</p>
                     
<p>There are currently 264 known monkey species.

      Monkeys can be divided into two groups, Old World monkeys that live in Africa and Asia, and New World monkeys that live in South America.
      
      A baboon is an example of an Old World monkey, while a marmoset is an example of a New World monkey.
      
      Apes are not monkeys.
      
      Some monkeys live on the ground, while others live in trees.
      
      Different monkey species eat a variety of foods, such as fruit, insects, flowers, leaves and reptiles.
      
      Most monkeys have tails.
      
      Groups of monkeys are known as a tribe,troop or mission.
      
      The Pygmy Marmoset is the smallest type of monkey, with adults weighing between 120 and 140 grams.
      The Mandrill is the largest type of monkey, with adult males weighing up to 35 kg.
      Capuchin monkeys are believed to be one of the smartest New World monkey species. They have the ability to use tools, learn new skills and show various signs of self-awareness.
      Spider monkeys get their name because of their long arms, legs and tail.
      The monkey is the 9th animal that appears on the Chinese zodiac, appearing as the zodiac sign in 2016.</p>
<p>December 14th is World Monkey Day a day where we celebrate and show love for all of our fellow monkeys and non-human primates.  Monkeys are very close to humans on the evolutionary scale — we share 99 percent of our DNA with chimpanzees.  
Monkeys are also very intelligent and often demonstrate behaviors that resemble our own</p>
