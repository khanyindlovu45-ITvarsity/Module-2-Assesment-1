                         <h3>GEMSBOK</h3>
                         <p>A gemsbok’s straight, rapier-like horns can reach 120cm in length, and are longer and narrower in the female. They use their horns in territorial combat and as lethal weapons against predators. Gemsbok can kill lions.
                              A low metabolism allows these antelopes to survive for much of the year without drinking. They get the moisture they need from their food, including desert melons that they dig up in times of drought.
                              Gemsbok minimise water loss through perspiration by allowing their body temperature to rise to an astonishing 45°C and then dissipating the stored heat at night. Overheating is averted by a filigree of blood vessels in the nose, known as the carotid rete, through which all the blood that passes to the brain is circulated and cooled.
                              With most other Kalahari antelope, one dominant breeding male controls a harem of females and young, and bachelor males form separate herds. By contrast, gemsbok form mixed herds of males and females.
                              After giving birth, a female  hides her calf for 3–6 weeks, remaining nearby and visiting a few times a day to nurse. The calf’s pale brown colour works as camouflage. It does not develop its striking black-and-white face markings until it is ready to join the herd with the mother.
                              Gemsbok or Oryx were traditionally found in the northwestern and western parts of South Africa, which is the Northern Cape, Kalahari, North West and Western Cape.  
 
                              In the present day, due to commercial game farming and through breeding and selling, they occur throughout South Africa on game farms. There are no Gemsbok in the Kruger National Park, but they can be seen in a number of other parks especially in the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park.
                               </p>
                               <p>Gemsbok prefer dry areas, open savannah and desert grassland.
                              They are gregarious and occur in medium to large breeding herds (mixed bulls, cows and calves), herds consisting of bulls only (bachelor herds) as well as territorial bulls.
                              Both Bulls and cows have horns. The bulls have horns that are more symmetrical and thicker towards the base and the cows often have longer horns, although thinner and often asymmetrical. Bulls are heavier and of stockier build than cows.Gemsbok reach sexual maturity after about two years. Usually one calf is born after which calf is hidden away (in tall grass or shrubs) from the herd for up to 6 weeks. The cow visits often to let the calf suckle. After the period of about six weeks the calf is introduced to the herd.They are mainly grazers (grass eaters) but also eat pods of especially the Camel thorn (Acacia erioloba), small shrubs and bushes. They also dig up roots and bulbs to eat, from which they get moisture and thus do not need water often. 
                        </p>
                        <p>Gemsbok are light brownish-grey to tan in colour, with lighter patches toward the bottom rear of the rump. Their tails are long and black in colour. A blackish stripe extends from the chin down the lower edge of the neck, through the juncture of the shoulder and leg along the lower flank of each side to the blackish section of the rear leg. They have muscular necks and shoulders, and their legs have white 'socks' with a black patch on the front of both the front legs, and both genders have long, straight horns. Comparably, the East African oryx lacks a dark patch at the base of the tail, has less black on the legs (none on the hindlegs), and less black on the lower flanks. One very rare colour morph is the "golden oryx", in which the gemsbok's black markings are muted and appear to be golden.</p>
