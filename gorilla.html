                         <h3>GORILLA</h3>
                         <p> There are two species of gorilla: eastern and western. The mountain gorilla is a sub-species of the eastern gorilla.
                        Mountain gorillas are endangered,there are an estimated 1,063 in the wild according to the latest census results (which come out every 5-10 years). 
                        </p>
                        <p>Mountain gorillas live in east-central Africa in just two isolated groups one in the Virunga Volcanoes (a region spanning 3 national parks in Uganda, Rwanda and Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and one in Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, Uganda, which connects to Sarambwe Nature Reserve, DRC.
                        They are found in high altitude montane and bamboo forests, which are surrounded by agriculture and settlements.
                        This means that exposure to human illnesses even a cold can have potentially detrimental impacts on gorillas as they are so genetically similar to us, but they haven't developed the necessary immunities.</p>
                        <p>An average male mountain gorilla can weigh 180kg (that is almost 30 stone), and measure 170cm (over 5.5 inch) tall.Mountain gorillas spend about a quarter of their day eating mainly leaves and shoots, but have also been known to eat snails, ants and bark (a good source of sodium). At night, mountain gorilla groups sleep together in nests on the ground, or in trees, that they make from foliage. 
                        Infants will share their mother's nests, staying safe and warm. This includes short barks when they are mildly alarmed or curious.   
                        To intimidate rivals, male gorillas strut with stiff legs, beat their chests, and use vocalisations like roars or hoots.  </p>
                    <p>Gorillas live in a range of habitats from swamps to forests. There are lowland gorillas which live in bamboo forests, swamps and lowland forests. There are also mountain gorillas which live in forests in the mountains.
                        Gorillas are mostly herbivores and eat plants. The plants they eat include leaves, stems pith, fruit, and bamboo. Sometimes they will eat insects, especially ants. A full grown adult male will eat around 50 pounds of food in a day.</p>
                 <p>Gorillas have long arms, even longer than their legs! They use their long arms to "knuckle-walk". This is where they use the knuckles on their hands to walk on all fours. They are mostly covered with brown hair. Gorillas from different areas may have different colored hair. For example, the western gorilla has the lightest hair and the mountain gorilla has the darkest. The western lowland gorilla can also have grayish hair and red colored forehead. When male gorillas get older their hair turns white on their back. These older males are called Silverback gorillas.
                  Gorillas have hands and feet like humans including opposable thumbs and big toes. Some gorillas in captivity have learned to use sign language to communicate with humans. Gorillas live in small groups called troops or bands. In each troop there is one dominant male Silverback, some female gorillas, and their offspring. Gorillas live around 35 years. They can live longer, up to 50 years, in captivity. They sleep at night in nests. Baby gorillas will stay in their mother's nests until they are around 2 Â½ years old. Gorillas are generally calm and passive animals, however, the Silverback will defend his troop if he feels threatened. They are highly intelligent and have now been observed using tools in the wild.
